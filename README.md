# Process Monitor

Process Monitor is a Go application that monitors processes and alerts on high CPU usage. It collects process metrics, processes the data, and sends email alerts when CPU usage exceeds a specified threshold.

## Features

- Executes the `top` command to collect process data
- Parses the output to extract process metrics (PID, CPU usage, command)
- Alerts via email when CPU usage exceeds a threshold
- Configurable email settings (sender, recipient, SMTP server)

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Go 1.16 or later installed
- Access to the `top` command (usually available on Unix-like systems)
- Environment variables:

  ðŸ““ `OUTPUT_FILE`: Path to the output file for the `top` command
  
  ðŸ““ `EMAIL`: Sender email address for alerts
  
  ðŸ““ `PASSWORD`: Password for the sender email address
  
  ðŸ““ `TO_EMAIL`: Recipient email address for alerts
  
  ðŸ““ `SMTP_HOST`: SMTP server hostname
  
  ðŸ““ `SMTP_PORT`: SMTP server port

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```ruby
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/process-monitor.git
   ```
2. Build the application:

```ruby
  go build -o monitoring main.go process.go collect.go alert.go fileUtil.go
```
3. Run the application:
```ruby
   ./monitoring
```
The application will continuously monitor the processes and send email alerts when CPU usage exceeds the threshold.

## Configuration
The following environment variables are used for configuration:

ðŸ““ `OUTPUT_FILE`: Path to the output file for the top command. Default: output.txt.

ðŸ““ `EMAIL`: Sender email address for alerts.

ðŸ““ `PASSWORD`: Password for the sender email address.

ðŸ““ `TO_EMAIL`: Recipient email address for alerts.

ðŸ““ `SMTP_HOST`: SMTP server hostname.

ðŸ““ `SMTP_PORT`: SMTP server port.

Ensure you set these environment variables correctly before running the application.
